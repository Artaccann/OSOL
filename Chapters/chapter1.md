This is just a test.

There is nothing else really.

YET.

I'm just trying how is the text appearing, based on its length. I'm also testing out my new loader and other scripts I do not understand. But I try! If this works, I managed to set it all up! Yay.

Now. This is the last sentence. There is really nothing else.

Why are you continuing?

Stop it.

There is really nothing.

...

Do you want to hear a joke?

Alright.

Here is a joke.

A man walks into a bar with a tiny piano and a tiny man playing it. The bartender, intrigued, asks, "Hey, where did you get that?" The man pulls out an old, dusty lamp and says, "I found this. It's got a genie inside who grants wishes, but there's a catch." The bartender, excited, grabs the lamp, rubs it, and a genie appears. "You have one wish," the genie booms. The bartender quickly says, "I wish for a million bucks!" Suddenly, the bar fills with ducks—thousands and thousands of ducks, quacking and flying everywhere. The bartender looks at the man in shock. The man sighs and says, "Yeah… you think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?"

Hahaha.

Now. This is the end.

Really.

Really, really.

*ugh*

Goodbye.
